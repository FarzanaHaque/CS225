/*
For every region in the SourceImage, mapTiles() should take the TileImage with average color closest to the average color of that region and place that TileImage into the MosaicCanvas in the same tile position as the SourceImageâ€™s region.

map_tiles - The locations of the tiles in the mosaic are defined by a MosaicCanvas. This function should create a new MosaicCanvas which is appropriately sized based on the rows and columns of tiles in the SourceImage. Then, each tile in the MosaicCanvas should be set to an appropriate TileImage, using a KDTree to find the Nearest Neighbor for each region.




There are two classes representing a color in this portion of the MP: HSLAPixel and Point<3>. You will need to convert between these different representations.

    Note that your points should be in H-S-L order and hue must be normalized to [0, 1]. That is, hue/360 should be the x

(0th dimension), saturation should be the y (1st dimension), and luminance should be the z

    (2nd dimension).

Use your KDTree class to find the nearest neighbor, which is the tile image that minimizes average color distances.
You can easily convert from a TileImage to its average color using TileImage::getAverageColor(). You will also need to convert from an average color to the TileImage that would generate that color. You may want to use the std::map class to do this.
